1. The Home_Lab repo was not being cloned into my laptop.
	- Permission denied error.
	- But the other repos were fine, I could push to the main.

2. Use this command to verify repository access
	-> ssh -T git@github.com
	-> It asked for the passkey and then it worked when I cloned the repo.

---------------------------------

I think I know how to continue with getting better at this Coding Project Explorer (CPE) stuff.

Keep working on projects - anything that your heart desires.
- Explore everything.

-- Then, make it into a video in your desktop.
- This will be the professional personality.
- Once you log into your desktop, it's purely business!

-- Your laptop, which is your new musical instrument that you'll carry everywhere and practice all the time.

----------------------------------

This will be the format of this project/repo.

-- The thought process, code, commands, everything in it's raw form.
-- THE JOURNEY - EXPLORATION - is what we're recording.

-- Just like Rick Steves but Europe of Coding Projects.
